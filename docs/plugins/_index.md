# Plugins

Plugins are one of the key features of Headlamp and allow to modify change
what and how information is displayed, as well as other functionality.
The ultimate goal of the plugins system is to allow vendors to build and deploy
Headlamp with extra functionality without having to maintain a fork of
the project.

*⚠️ IMPORTANT FOR USERS/ADMINS:* Plugins are run on the client and thus may access to
any data that the frontend has. Make sure you only use plugins you trust!

*⚠️ IMPORTANT FOR DEVS:* The plugins system and plugin lib is still in the process of
being consolidated. This means that 1) it's subject to change, 2) you are very
welcome to contribute to it with different use cases and/or development.
