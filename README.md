# Headlamp

An easy-to-use and versatile dashboard for Kubernetes.

*⚠️ IMPORTANT:* This is an early version of Headlamp, which is under active
development and thus subject to frequent and, potentially, breaking changes.

## Introduction / Demo

Here is an introduction video with the motivation for creating headlamp

## Features

Headlamp was created to be a Kubernetes web UI that has the traditional functionality of other
web UIs/dashboards available (i.e. to list and view resources) as well as other features:

  * Vendor independent / Generic
  * Common ops for Kubernetes clusters
  * Multi-cluster
  * To be run hosted (in-cluster) or locally (desktop app)
  * Extensible
  * Clean / modern UI
  * Read-write (actions based on permissions)
